<p>
By analyzing the raw materials contained within a device, we pinpoint the global hotspots where human rights violations are most likely to occur.
Our goal is to provide a risk analysis that highlights the areas that should be focused for further activities, like further data collection, audits of suppliers, 
or exploration of design alternatives. 
In the following, we describe the basic concepts, assumptions, calculations and limitations behind Fairtronics.

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

<h3>Electronics Products consist of Components</h3>

When you create a social impact report with Fairtronics you can configure an electronics <b>product</b> from our <b>component</b> database,
where we collect data about electronics components (like resistors, circuit boards, cables, ...). While we strive for completeness, especially in the beginning, 
you might have to select a component that fits "good enough" to the one that is actually part of your product.

<h3>Components are made from Raw Materials</h3>

For each <b>component</b> in our database we collect data about its total weight and the share in weight of the raw <b>materials</b> it is made of.
Again, while we strive for completeness, in the beginning we focus on metals. You should be aware that weight is only a proxy for what
we are actually interested in: working hours or potential for human harm. As long as we are missing better data sources, we assume that 
material weight corresponds to the human effort and therefore potential of harm that can be associated with this material.

<h3>Raw Materials are produced in different Countries</h3>

For each raw material (iron, copper, silver, ...), we collect data about world production share of different countries.
So, in effect, we assume that for example copper in one component in your product is a mix of all copper sources in the world. 

<h3>Countries show different risks concerning Social Impacts</h3>

Global institutions like the International Labor Organization or the Unicef provide reports and estimates for human rights conditions
in different countries. While one singular supplier might perform better (or worse), we assume that these estimates provide an
indication how likely it is that human rights were violated during the production of materials in this country.

    We distinguish between X different impact categories and collect data for each. The impact categories are described in more detail here.
